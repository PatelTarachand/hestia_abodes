    <p class="lead">Pre-leased properties have emerged as one of the most attractive investment options for those seeking guaranteed returns and stable rental income. In 2025, with the commercial real estate market showing strong recovery and growth, investing in pre-leased properties offers a unique opportunity to earn passive income while building long-term wealth.</p>

    <h2>What Are Pre-leased Properties?</h2>
    <p>Pre-leased properties are commercial real estate assets that come with existing tenants and lease agreements already in place.

    <p>These properties typically include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Office spaces leased to IT companies</li>
        <li>Retail outlets with established brands</li>
        <li>Warehouses with logistics companies</li>
        <li>Industrial units with manufacturing firms</li>
        <li>Healthcare facilities and clinics</li>
